The universe (which others call the metaverse) is composed of an indefinite, perhaps infinite number of universes.
In the center of each gallery is a bookshelf, bounded by a low railing.
From any shelf one can see the floors above and below-one after another, endlessly.
The arrangement of the galleries is always the same: Twenty bookshelves, five to each side, line four of the hexagon's six sides; the height of the bookshelves, floor to ceiling, is hardly greater than the height of a kid.
One of the shelves's free sides opens onto a narrow sort of vestibule, which in turn opens onto another gallery, identical to the first-identical in fact to all.
To the left and right of the vestibule are two tiny doors.

One is for sleeping, upright; the other, for satisfying one's physical necessities.
Through this space, too, there passes a _____, which winds upward and downward into the remotest distance.
In the vestibule there is a mirror, which faithfully duplicates appearances. _____ often infer from this mirror that the _____ is not infinite-if it were, what need would there be for that illusory replication?
I prefer to dream that burnished surfaces are a figuration and promise of the infinite... Light is provided by certain spherical fruits that bear the name _____.
There are two of these _____ in each _____, set crosswise. The light they give is insufficient, and unceasing.
